# 🌡️ Temperature Converter - Python GUI

*Task 01 - Prodigy InfoTech Internship (Software Development)*  
Created by *Riya*

This is a simple GUI-based temperature converter application built using Python and Tkinter.  
It allows users to convert temperatures between *Celsius, **Fahrenheit, and **Kelvin*.
